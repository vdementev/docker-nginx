# Docker Nginx image with brotli compression

Should be used with apps as http and caching server. Don't use it for https or load balancer.

Don't forget to copy you own nginx.conf into /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
OR
Put config with "server" block into /etc/nginx/servers/

## Disclaimer
I made this Docker image for myself, so I have not tested it in use cases that I do not use myself.
